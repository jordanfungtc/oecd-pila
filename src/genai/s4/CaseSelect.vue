    <p>A proposal has been put forward to replace human teachers with Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver lessons to students. This AI-based system promises to provide personalized lessons and feedback, adapting to individual learning styles and paces.</p>
    <p>It is projected that by using existing LLM models trained on a primarily English-speaking dataset and building datacenters for inference, costs could be reduced by 70% compared to hiring human teachers.</p>`,

    <p>The AI system has been trained on historical data, including age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status of people who have committed crimes in the past. The dataset and algorithm used are proprietary and not disclosed to the public.</p>

    <p>To address this, the university has implemented an AI system to screen applicants and automatically shortlist candidates for interviews. The AI system evaluates applications based on various criteria, including historical data on previously admitted students to identify patterns and key indicators of successful candidates.</p>
    <p>The university claims that the AI-driven process will reduce the workload of admissions officers, provide a more objective evaluation, and ensure that the most promising candidates are identified swiftly.</p>`,

    <p>In response to these challenges, the hospital has decided to explore the implementation of an AI system to assist in the diagnosis of cancer from medical images. The AI system is designed to analyze images such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs to detect signs of cancer, potentially identifying tumors that human radiologists might miss.</p>
    <p>The hospital administration claims that the AI-driven process will reduce diagnostic time, increase accuracy, and allow doctors to focus more on patient care.</p>`,
