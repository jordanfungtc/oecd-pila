  <h2>What are Word Embeddings?</h2>
  <p>
    When you think of the word "cat," how would you describe it? You may think
    of it being a mammal, it can move, has a tail, and so on. These are features
    that can help describe what a cat is. One way of creating word embeddings is
    by assigning numerical values to a set of features to show how closely
    related the word are to the features, for example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      assign 1 to show that the word "cat" is associated with the feature (e.g.,
      has a tail)
    </li>
    <li>
      assign 0 to show that the word "cat" is not associated with the feature
      (e.g., has wheels)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Using the 5 features below, we obtain the word embeddings for "cat" to be
    (0,1,1,0,1):
