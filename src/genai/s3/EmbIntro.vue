  <h2>Creating Word Embeddings</h2>
  <p>
    When we think of the word "ðŸ˜º cat," we can associate it with features such
    as "mammal," "can move," and "has a tail." To create a word embedding,
    language models can assign values to these features based on how closely
    they are associated with the word "ðŸ˜º cat." For instance, we can use 1 and 0
    to indicate the presence or absence of a feature.
