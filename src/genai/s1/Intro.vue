      <h2>What is AI?</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever wondered how your smartphone recognizes your voice
        commands, how your email filters out spam, how your car's navigation
        system finds the best route, or how your favourite music streaming
        service suggests songs you might like? These tasks are all accomplished
        with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
      </p>
      <p>
        AI is a branch of computer science that enables machines to perform
        tasks that typically require human intelligence, like making predictions
        and decisions or solving problems. A key area of AI is machine learning
        (ML), where computers learn patterns from large amounts of data and
        build a mathematical model.
