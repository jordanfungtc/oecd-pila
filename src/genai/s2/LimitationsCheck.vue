      <p>
        LLMs create responses by predicting the next word based on their
        training data â€“ they are not truly intelligent. As such, LLMs can
        sometimes produce responses that seem accurate at first glance but are
        not entirely reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, in the conversation you just had with the LLM, some of the
        statistics included in the generated essay were inaccurate. Can you
        identify which ones?
